			<h1>The all too common problem of losing interest in a project</h1>
			<p>It seems quite common that a project tends to lose interest because the individual or team does not know where to go next. When the next step of the project requires a decision to be made that the team is unsure of or lacks knowledge in, a large barrier is then realized. The common result is to procrastinate or to put off this problem in hopes that it will possibly go away or time will provide an answer to the problem. Sometimes this does work out, but more often than not, this will be the stopping point for this project.</p>
			<p>I've personally ran into the issue of not finding the joy or fun in a project when something like this occurs. So, this sucks. How does one address the problem? We want to work on these projects, but ideas come and go much more often than is conducive to making a project successfully produce an end result.</p>
			<h2>A little background</h2>
			<p>For the past half a year, I've been working a relatively simple circuit design that has quite a few little bits and pieces to it. I knew what I needed to do and how to do it. Or so I thought. The little intracacies of the circuit and the components being used knocked me out of my comfort zone and generated a barrier.</p>
			<p>I worked on it off and on for a few months, slowly widdling things down. There's no doubt though, I had definitely lost the feeling of having fun I initially had when starting the project.</p>
			<p> What's going on? Why isn't this fun anymore? How can I make it enjoyable again? I still think the project is cool, so what's the deal?</p>
			<h2>A Possible Solution</h2>
			<p>Sitting in a coffee shop one day, I began to think about the differences I noticed between work and my personal projects. My work projects have been moving along and have been quite enjoyable even though there has been very apparent road blocks. What's the difference? Then it clicked</p>
			<p><strong>I wasn't planning things out</strong></p>
			<p>This simple but vital process wasn't taking place and was leaving my thoughts in a jumbled up mess, aka, the barrier. I realized that since all these little bits and pieces were more than my brain was capable meshing together without any external help, I was becoming easily overwhelmed and backing down from working on the project. I didn't know what <i>exactly</i> I needed to do next. It's true, I may not be able to plan for everything that happens, but I was imagining and building a road without knowing the terrain I would be building upon. I knew where I was going and had a general idea of what I wanted the system to look like, but nothing much more refined than that.</p>
			<h2>High Level Diagrams are Awesome</h2>
			<p>Since I was most comfortable on this high level and this was what I had thought through the most, I figured it'd be wise to start there. Flow charts really helped me visualize and see things in a more concise sense. There's something visually satisfying and comforting when you see a system fully layed out. Not only does this help and reduce the burden on your memory and interal abilities to link things together, but it helps you easily find issues in your logic and system.</p>
			<p>A totally unexpected effect of planning and diagraming the system was that it revealed new concepts and ideas.</p>
			<p>This project started to become fun again</p>
			<p>By all means, this may not work for everyone, but it's at least worth a shot. Finding the source of the discomfort and ruthlessly analyzing it until a possible solution is found. This kind of habit doesn't happen overnight, but is more of something that is built and refined over years and years of analyzing one's thought processes and habits. Either way, by planning things out by writing up documentation in the form of digrams, Git comments, notes on schematics, etc, a feeling of progress and moving forward becomes more prominant rather than the feeling of running into a wall. Try not to keep things in your head, write them down and get them out. Let your mind ponder about the things that are more worthwhile than figuring out a solution in your head while trying to avoid documentation like the plague. Documentation itself may not be fun, but a side effect is that it creates and opens doors to having fun and removes the roadblocks keeping you from having fun.</p>
